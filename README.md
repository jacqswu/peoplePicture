*People Picture* is an interactive installation created at Studio TheGreenEyl that turns people into pixels. Individual full-body recordings are added to a public screen, together creating an animated text or image representative of the diverse attendees at each conference.

Full code is private, however specific screenshots can be found in the /codeSnippets folder.
